SOME THINGS TO TRY:

* Where are accidents happening? To determine this, find distances between the longitude and latitude of the data points. visualize and look for clusters. MAYBE overlay a map? Or just find clusters and pin that on a map, take a screenshot.
Should weight accidents with more deaths or damages?
maybe: create a few maps. some examples:
Map of all accidents
Map of fatal accidents
Map of bicyclist accidents
.. ect...

* Some simple counting things..
What percentage of injured people are bicyclists?
Graph of accident frequency based on month, day of week, ect

* Clustering: Just run some clustering algorithms see what they spit out. Are there a few different categories? I suspect Long/Lat will have a pretty big effect here, so try clustering without those.

* Run the CC-coefficents part of PCA

* Cross-reference with weather data? See if there is a connection between storms, snow, ect, and accidents
Compare normal and storm days

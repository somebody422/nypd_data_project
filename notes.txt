SOME THINGS TO TRY:

* Where are accidents happening? To determine this, find distances between the longitude and latitude of the data points. visualize and look for clusters. MAYBE overlay a map? Or just find clusters and pin that on a map, take a screenshot.
Should weight accidents with more deaths or damages?
maybe: create a few maps. some examples:
Map of all accidents
Map of fatal accidents
Map of bicyclist accidents
.. ect...

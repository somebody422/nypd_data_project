Working directory for the final project of data mining class.

## Assignment
Parse through a large database of traffic accidents in NYC. Try to come up with some analysis, and explain patterns in the data


## Approach
Used python to parse through data, and matplotlib to generate graphs
* Created a script to random sample the database and create smaller data sets. This was useful for testing
* Automatically generated numerical representations (Enum class) of strings to lower size of data structures in memory
* Ran K-means to generate cluster centers of long/lat location of accidents. Those centers were then graphed
